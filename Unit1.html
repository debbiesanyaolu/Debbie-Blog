<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
<p>In the modern world today technology plays a big role. With the use of computers and software, businesses use technology to ensure that their department runs smoothly. It helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition by having computers with passwords and security. It can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition. A lot of businesses are also subjected to vandalism and security threats. [1] Technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers. Quick and clear interaction with clients from employees is necessary. Things like websites enable people to find answers to their questions. When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image.</p>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>
<p>In order to complete a successful digital project there are many tools, skills, methods and resources that can be used. A great tool would be things like the latest MacBook Pro with features like Vs Code, Trello, Xcode and Github. These applications help for different skills needed to perform a successful project.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trello helps with organisational skills as well as time management and planning.</li>
    <li>Github helps with research.</li>
    <li>Slack helps with communication and teamwork.</li>

<br><br>

</ul>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Link to your Trello board.</h4>
<p>As mentioned previously planning is the most important stage when completing a successful project, for example; a website. There are a number of platforms that assist project planning and management each with respective advantages and disadvantages. Trello is a known management tool for projects, it helps to track your progress with the task and how you are getting on. However it does not does not allow you to assign deadlines to tasks which is a key part of time management. It is therefore key when using Trello to either use a separate tool or be extremely mindful of any time constraints within the project.

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h4>
<p>There are many reasons as to why digital projects fail, one reason as mentioned earlier is time management. Without having a proper schedule of when things should be completed by, things would be rushed and completed insufficiently. In terms of business there are many risks like cyber risks, these can cause many problems within a business which may lead to failure such as financial loss, disruption or damage to the companies reputation. [2] Technical risks can be prevented or quickly identified through a series of quality management methods, which the producer complies from development to launching a new product. [3]</p>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. How do you select the right kind of technology for the job.</h4>
<p>When choosing what IT systems and software are needed for a project, I would first do my research and find out what their pros and cons are. To accomplish a project, flexibility in the choice of software development methods are needed to choose the right one for the job. The key to choosing the right technology is to also understand what you’re already doing well, and what you need to do better. The hardest stage is figuring out what software options will give the greatest results for the project. There can be times where the option chosen might not have everything that is required, hence why it is best to determine this early within the project. I have chosen to use;</p>
<ul>
    <li>MacBook Pro - As I find I work best on the latest laptops.</li>
    <li>Trello - I prefer to use an organiser online rather than noting things down.</li>
    <li>Slack - This is to communicate with my tutor if I need any help and is quicker than email.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code - I find I perform  best using VS Code.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h4>
<p>A few of the technologies I have chosen have facilitated me to accomplish my completed project. A few of them were chosen while planning was in process in order to achieve certain requirements.
    These included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trello - Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done. It’s boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. [4] It is a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. However it isn't just for work, you can use it to organize just about anything. [5]</li>
<li>Git - Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. [6] The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. [7]</li>    
<li>Github - GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, it is the service for projects that use Git. [6] Almost every developer working on a group project or individually uses GitHub as most important tool due to its capability of making version control easier. GitHub provides developers an essential tool which helps in best code practices, on the other hand it does help in showcasing your recent work also. [8]</li>    
    </ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h4>
<p>There are many guidelines and constraints that have an impact on digital projects, one of the most recent and important of which is; GDPR. GDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU). [9] GDPR impacts website projects in many ways, here are a few; </p>
<ul>
    <li>Forms: active opt-in - Forms that invite users to subscribe to newsletters or indicate contact preferences must default to “no” or be blank. You will need to check your forms to ensure this is the case.</li>
<li>Unbundled opt-in - The consent you are asking for should be set out separately for accepting the terms and conditions, and acceptance of consent for other ways of using data.</li>
<li>Granular opt-in - Users should be able to provide separate consent for different types of processing.</li>
<li>Easy to withdraw permission or opt-out - It must be just as easy to remove consent as it was to grant it, and individuals always need to know they have the right to withdraw their consent.</li>
<li>Named parties - Your web forms must clearly identify each party for which the consent is being granted. It isn’t enough to say specifically defined categories of third-party organisations. They need to be named. [10]</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h4>
<p>While completing this project a few of the IT tools used continued to remain the same throughout e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Trello</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
<p>However midway through a few other tools were added, e.g:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Unsplash - Unsplash is a website where photographers can share high resolution images, make them publicly available for everyone for free even for commercial use.</li>
<li>Google Fonts - Google Fonts is a library of 916 free licensed fonts, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS.</li>
<li>W3 Schools - W3Schools is an educational website for learning web technologies online. Content includes tutorials and references relating to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h4>
    <p>The IT tools selected were appropriate and helped me to carry out and complete all of the assignments set. In the future however I would try and research into different types of alternative IT tools. I would do this to make sure that all the most effective ones have been chosen.
        </p>
<p>For example other code writing software exists such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sublime Text - Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.</li>
<li>Atom - Atom is a cross-platform code editor created by developers for developers. It is open source, and much like WordPress, Atom users can submit packages and themes for the software. It looks pretty and you can change the appearance by installing themes. It comes with a built-in package manager to extend it, smart autocompletion, file system browser, multiple panes, find and replace.
    </li>
<li>Notepad ++ - Notepad++ is a free and open source code editor for Windows. It is easy to use for beginners and highly powerful for advanced users. It comes with syntax highlighting for many languages including PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It also comes with a built-in FTP plugin that allows you to connect to your server and edit files directly without leaving the editor. [15]</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
<p>Whilst building my website I struggled a little bit with structuring how I want it to look. Positioning images and text in a certain way, I overcame this by researching. Other things I struggled even more with are spacing, navigation and user convenience. Overall given the time constraints and the level of improvement from no knowledge I am happy with my website. I look forward to broadening my knowledge and implementing new pieces of code into my work.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h4>
<p>A few more further improvements I could make to my project are including headers and footers to the pages and functions such as mobile friendliness and the designs of all the elements on the pages. Other improvements could include an element of interactivity on the website such as when you hover over the pictures, the title appears on a transparent background. I would also have the recommended blog posts on the home page to alternate.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h4>
<p> There were a few requirements that needed to be followed in order for the project to be fit for purpose. Making sure that there was appropriate content for the website and collecting  information for it was one of them. I executed this effectively and left it prepared in google docs before building as it has the ability to do spelling and grammar checks on the content before pasting it into Visual Studio Code. Another requirement that needed to be followed was at the end of the project making sure that all of the pages did not have any errors. This was important because it can affect the way the website works. I have executed QA testing throughout the website to ensure no user journeys are interrupted and the code is functioning as desired.
    </p>
    <br><br>
<h4> Unit 1 - Outcome 3 - 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h4>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, below are the IT tools used within this project, they have been assessed based on how well they work within this project.</p>
<ul>
<li> Trello - Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done. It’s boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. [4] It is a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. However it isn't just for work, you can use it to organize just about anything. [5] The disadvantage of Trello is I could not set a date as to when the tasks have to be done by which made it harder to make sure the project stays on track with how much time was remaining.   </li>
<li>Github - GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, it is the service for projects that use Git. [6] Almost every developer working on a group project or individually uses GitHub as most important tool due to its capability of making version control easier. GitHub provides developers an essential tool which helps in best code practices, on the other hand it does help in showcasing your recent work also. [8] The disadvantage of Github is it  does not have the ability to edit within the tool.
    </li>
    <li> Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code allows for improved efficiency through smart tools such as finishing off lines of code and readability. Efficiency could be improved through having a live area that updates the finished product as the code is written.
        </li>

</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 3 - 3.2  Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h4>
    <p> There are many ways in which productivity and efficiency can be improved within any project. They can be affected in a number of ways:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Distractions</li>
<li>The level of planning
    </li>
    <li> The level of knowledge
        </li>
        <li> The effectiveness of IT tools</li>

    </ul>
    <p>However some of these ways can be controlled, for example the level of planning. Also you can’t always predict what obstacles may arise through the lack of knowledge and if you can quickly figure them out. It is important to construct a successful plan to improve productivity and efficiency.
        </p>
        <br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 3 - 3.3  Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
    </h4>
    <p> It is important to identify issues before developing solutions for them, below i have stated certain issues and how to overcome them:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Lack of knowledge - This can be resolved by using different IT tools, like online tutorials. Also by bouncing ideas off other members of the group in order to find the best solution.
        </li>
        <li> The time taken to write certain code - Repeating code will help you to lower the time spent and therefore increase efficiency.
        </li>
            <li>The time taken to write content - This can be resolved by splitting content within a team of people to improve efficiency.
</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br><br>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 3 - 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
    </h4>
    <p>I would go about testing digital solutions by firstly assessing the effectiveness of them. I would consider:</p>
    <ul> <li> How easy or difficult it is to use</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Cost</li>
                <li>The quality of the final product
                </li>
</ul>
<p>
        I would test these by researching experience’s of other people with a range of tools. This would help to give a widespread overview of the advantages and disadvantages for each of the tools. However the best way to determine whether the tools are efficient enough is to test them out yourself, this is because the UI may be easier or more complex for one to use than others.

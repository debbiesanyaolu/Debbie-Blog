<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h4>
    <p> Upon opening the website the user is greeted with a large white coloured banner, with the text “Welcome to my blog”, the top of the page holds the menu, which helps the user navigate between pages, the consistencies here will be seen in the way content is presented, the background colour and the menu style on each page, 
            Upon clicking the blog page, the user is met with another menu bar, the options here being to choose “unit 1”, “unit 2” and ”references”. 
            Clicking unit 1 will bring the user to the page where the questions for unit 1 have been attempted, the font chosen was ‘noto sans JP’, which was appropriately coloured black so that the user could easily read the content, in the top left corner there is also an image, there are also screenshots of how my website looks in different browsers, such as Google Chrome and firefox. Moving further down the page the user then gains access to my trello board via link, upon clicking this link, a new tab will open with the requested page, which allows the user to, when the trello board is inspected, go back to where they had left off reading. 
            This link feature should be consistent throughout my site.
            Where i could improve would be helping the user with a simple option transition between my blog pages where most of the content is.

<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h4>
<p>A main restriction when making a website is copyright compliance. It protects your work as well as others when you make the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Originally literary, musical, dramatic and artistic work including illustration and photography.</li>
    <li>Sound and music recordings.</li>
    <li>The layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works.</li>
    <li>Broadcasts</li>
    <li>Original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases</li>
    <li>Film and television recordings</li>
</ul>
<p>Copyright protects your work from the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> Putting it on the internet</li>
<li> Copying your work</li>
<li> Distributing copies of it, whether free of charge or for sale</li>
<li> Performing, showing or playing your work in public</li>
<li>Making an adaptation of your work</li>
<li> Renting or lending copies of your work [11]</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them
        </h4>
        <p> There are many ways in which you could overcome issues that people with disabilities may face when using the web, these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Use of alt tags - When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is.
                </li>
                <li> Create subtitles and transcripts - If your web content regularly includes videos, try to provide subtitles, especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content.</li>
                <li> Put periods in abbreviations - If you're abbreviating something in HTML, put periods in between each letter.
                    </li>
                    <li> Describe your links - When embedding a link in a post, it's more useful to describe the link, rather than just telling the reader to "click here."
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                                Utilize colour control - Practicing smart colour choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colors, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colorblind users). Dark colour text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences. [12]
                        </li>
</ul>

<h4> Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for website.</h4>
<p>There are many different file types that correspond to making a website with different coding languages, each of which have different functions when making a website. The most frequently used include:</p>
<ul>
    <li> JavaScript - It is used primarily for programming a web browser  with static HTML and CSS interactive. [13]</li>
    <li>HTML - HyperText Markup Language is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. [14]</li>
            <li>CSS - Cascading StyleSheet describes how HTML elements are to be displayed.</li>
            <li>JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group file - are image files mainly used for photos</li>
</ul>

<p>I first heard about Code Nation through my older brother, he spoke about it so passionately. I then went on to do my own research and realised that coding is something I wanted to learn a lot more about. I put an application through and heard back very rapidly, quicker than I had expected. So far my experience at Code Nation has been an amazing one, I have learnt so many new things about coding and also about myself.</p>

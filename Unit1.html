<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
<p>In the modern world today technology plays a big role. With the use of computers and software, businesses use technology to ensure that their department runs smoothly. It helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition by having computers with passwords and security. It can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition. A lot of businesses are also subjected to vandalism and security threats. [1] Technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers. Quick and clear interaction with clients from employees is necessary. Things like websites enable people to find answers to their questions. When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image.</p>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>
<p>In order to complete a successful digital project there are many tools, skills, methods and resources that can be used. A great tool would be things like the latest MacBook Pro with features like Vs Code, Trello, Xcode and Github. These applications help for different skills needed to perform a successful project.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trello helps with organisational skills as well as time management and planning.</li>
    <li>Github helps with research.</li>
    <li>Slack helps with communication and teamwork.</li>

<br><br>

</ul>
<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h4>
<p>As mentioned previously planning is the most important stage when completing a successful project, for example; a website. There are a number of platforms that assist project planning and management each with respective advantages and disadvantages. Trello is a known management tool for projects, it helps to track your progress with the task and how you are getting on. However it does not does not allow you to assign deadlines to tasks which is a key part of time management. It is therefore key when using Trello to either use a separate tool or be extremely mindful of any time constraints within the project.</p>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h4>
<p>There are many reasons as to why digital projects fail, one reason as mentioned earlier is time management. Without having a proper schedule of when things should be completed by, things would be rushed and completed insufficiently. In terms of business there are many risks like cyber risks, these can cause many problems within a business which may lead to failure such as financial loss, disruption or damage to the companies reputation. [2] Technical risks can be prevented or quickly identified through a series of quality management methods, which the producer complies from development to launching a new product. [3]</p>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. How do you select the right kind of technology for the job.</h4>
<p>When choosing what IT systems and software are needed for a project, I would first do my research and find out what their pros and cons are. To accomplish a project, flexibility in the choice of software development methods are needed to choose the right one for the job. The key to choosing the right technology is to also understand what you’re already doing well, and what you need to do better. The hardest stage is figuring out what software options will give the greatest results for the project. There can be times where the option chosen might not have everything that is required, hence why it is best to determine this early within the project. I have chosen to use;</p>
<ul>
    <li>MacBook Pro - As I find I work best on the latest laptops.</li>
    <li>Trello - I prefer to use an organiser online rather than noting things down.</li>
    <li>Slack - This is to communicate with my tutor if I need any help and is quicker than email.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code - I find I perform  best using VS Code.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h4>
<p>A few of the technologies I have chosen have facilitated me to accomplish my completed project. A few of them were chosen while planning was in process in order to achieve certain requirements.
    These included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trello - Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done. It’s boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. [4] It is a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. However it isn't just for work, you can use it to organize just about anything. [5]</li>
<li>Git - Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. [6] The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. [7]</li>    
<li>Github - GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, it is the service for projects that use Git. [6] Almost every developer working on a group project or individually uses GitHub as most important tool due to its capability of making version control easier. GitHub provides developers an essential tool which helps in best code practices, on the other hand it does help in showcasing your recent work also. [8]</li>    
    </ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1 - 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h4>
<p>There are many guidelines and constraints that have an impact on digital projects, one of the most recent and important of which is; GDPR. GDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU). [9] GDPR impacts website projects in many ways, here are a few; </p>
<ul>
    <li>Forms: active opt-in - Forms that invite users to subscribe to newsletters or indicate contact preferences must default to “no” or be blank. You will need to check your forms to ensure this is the case.</li>
<li>Unbundled opt-in - The consent you are asking for should be set out separately for accepting the terms and conditions, and acceptance of consent for other ways of using data.</li>
<li>Granular opt-in - Users should be able to provide separate consent for different types of processing.</li>
<li>Easy to withdraw permission or opt-out - It must be just as easy to remove consent as it was to grant it, and individuals always need to know they have the right to withdraw their consent.</li>
<li>Named parties - Your web forms must clearly identify each party for which the consent is being granted. It isn’t enough to say specifically defined categories of third-party organisations. They need to be named. [10]</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h4>
<p>While completing this project a few of the IT tools used continued to remain the same throughout e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Trello</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
<p>However midway through a few other tools were added, e.g:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Unsplash - Unsplash is a website where photographers can share high resolution images, make them publicly available for everyone for free even for commercial use.</li>
<li>Google Fonts - Google Fonts is a library of 916 free licensed fonts, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS.</li>
<li>W3 Schools - W3Schools is an educational website for learning web technologies online. Content includes tutorials and references relating to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h4>
    <p>The IT tools selected were appropriate and helped me to carry out and complete all of the assignments set. In the future however I would try and research into different types of alternative IT tools. I would do this to make sure that all the most effective ones have been chosen.
        </p>
<p>For example other code writing software exists such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sublime Text</li>
<li>Atom</li>
<li>Coda</li>
<li>Text Wrangler</li>
<li>Text Mate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2 - 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
